# Display management via layouts.

In this section, we'll focus on managing the layout of your site. We'll go from general logic to counterintuitive examples (creation of sections, menus, pages, teasers, sliders, etc.).
We rely on Layout Builder, a core module of Drupal 9/10. "Drupal's Layout Builder enables content editors and site builders to quickly and easily create visual layouts for content display. Users can customize how content is organized on a single page or across multiple content types, or even create custom landing pages with an easy-to-use drag-and-drop interface" from </i> de [la documentation de drupal](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/layout-builder)
